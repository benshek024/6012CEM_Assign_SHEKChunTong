            <h1>Yale School of Art Seeks Director / Tenure-Track Faculty Member in Graphic Design</h1>
            <h2>December 20, 2021</h2>
            <p>The Yale School of Art invites applications worldwide for a tenured or tenure-track faculty appointment in the area of Graphic Design to begin July 1, 2022.

The successful candidate should have strategic leadership skills, a collaborative approach to management, and a desire to innovate the Graphic Design area of study within the School of Art and wider university. A record of expanding and diversifying access to educational opportunities for historically underrepresented and marginalized communities is central to this goal and a crucial criteria for consideration. A fully engaged presence on campus is required in order to actively participate in the University and New Haven communities. The position requires the candidate to remain active professionally while teaching in a demanding academic environment.</p>
